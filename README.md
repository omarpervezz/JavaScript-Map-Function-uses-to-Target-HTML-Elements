#The JavaScript Map function is used to target and manipulate HTML elements in a web document. It allows developers to create a mapping between keys and values, where keys can represent elements or unique identifiers (such as element IDs), and values can be references to the corresponding HTML elements or data associated with them. By using the Map function, developers can efficiently access and interact with specific elements in the document, making it a valuable tool for web development and dynamic content management.
